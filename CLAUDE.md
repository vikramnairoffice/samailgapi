# Simple Gmail REST Mailer

## Project Overview

A completely overhauled Python-based email marketing application focused on Gmail REST API integration with personalized invoice generation. The system has been streamlined to use Gmail REST API exclusively, removing SMTP complexity and authentication issues. Features simplified token-based Gmail authentication, intelligent content management, and comprehensive error handling for reliable email delivery.

## üìÅ FILE ORGANIZATION RULES

### Core Directory Structure:
- **Core folder**: Only store essential code files (.py, .js, .html, etc.)
- **Test files**: Store in separate `/tests` folder in core directory
- **Cache files**: Store outside core folder (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.gradio`, temp files)

### File Placement Guidelines:
- ‚úÖ **Core directory**: Main application code, modules, utilities
- ‚úÖ **Tests folder**: Unit tests, integration tests, test utilities
- ‚úÖ **Outside core**: Cache files, temporary files, build artifacts, logs

## Gmail REST API Configuration

### Authentication System
- **Gmail REST API Only**: Simplified authentication using direct token upload
- **Required Token Scope**: `['https://mail.google.com/']` for full Gmail access
- **Token File Format**: Named as `<email>.json` (e.g., `user@gmail.com.json`)
- **Multi-Account Support**: Upload multiple token files for campaign distribution

### Campaign Modes
- **Lead Distribution**: Distributes leads evenly across all uploaded Gmail accounts
- **Attachment Types**: Invoice (generated), PDF (from directory), Image (from directory)
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable send delays to prevent API quota issues

### Gmail API Endpoints Used
- **Profile URL**: `https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/profile`
- **Send URL**: `https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages/send`
- **Required Scope**: `['https://mail.google.com/']`

## UI Development Guidelines

### Interface Framework Requirements
- **UI Framework**: MUST use Gradio exclusively for all user interface development
- **No HTML/CSS**: Do not create custom HTML, CSS, or other web technologies
- **No Alternative Frameworks**: Do not use Streamlit, Flask, Django, or any other web frameworks
- **Gradio Components**: Use only Gradio's built-in components (gr.Button, gr.Textbox, gr.File, etc.)
- **Styling**: Use Gradio's theming and built-in styling options only

## Technical Architecture

### Gmail REST API Integration
- **Stateless Design**: Each email sent via independent Gmail REST API call
- **Token Management**: Direct token file loading with scope validation
- **Error Handling**: Gmail API-specific error categorization and recovery
- **Multi-Threading**: Campaign workers with independent token file access
- **Progress Tracking**: Event-driven updates with real-time UI feedback

### Content Generation System
- **Template-Based**: Professional subject lines and email bodies from templates
- **Dynamic Invoices**: Generated per recipient with personalized account details
- **Flexible Attachments**: Support for generated invoices, random PDFs, or images
- **Sender Personalization**: Business or personal sender name generation

## Security & Best Practices

- Direct Gmail token file management without OAuth flow complexity
- Isolated token storage per Gmail account with standardized naming
- Gmail REST API rate limiting and quota management
- Comprehensive error handling with actionable debugging information
- Clean codebase without legacy authentication artifacts
- Test-driven development ensuring reliability and maintainability

## Code Standards & Restrictions

### Unicode Character Policy
**STRICTLY PROHIBITED**: No Unicode characters, emojis, or special symbols in code files
- **Banned**: Emojis (üöÄ, üìß, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå, etc.)
- **Banned**: Unicode progress bars (‚ñà, ‚ñë)
- **Banned**: Unicode bullet points (‚Ä¢)
- **Banned**: Any non-ASCII characters in code
- **Allowed**: Standard ASCII characters only (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, basic punctuation)
- **Allowed**: Essential encoding/decoding functions (base64, UTF-8) for API compatibility

**Rationale**: Unicode characters cause constant compatibility issues across different systems and environments.
