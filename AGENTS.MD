Context
I am a solo developer working on personal/small projects
This is NOT an enterprise-level project
I prefer simple, direct solutions over "best practices"
I'm a vibe coder who values shipping over perfect architecture

### Development Standards & Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: All code must be developed using TDD methodology
- Write tests before or alongside implementation
   - Test each function in isolation
   - Include integration tests for function interactions
Don't add abstractions until we actually need them
Don't build for imaginary future requirements
Don't add complex error handling for edge cases that probably won't happen
Don't suggest design patterns unless the problem actually requires them
Don't optimize prematurely
Don't add configuration for things that rarely change

1. **STRICT PROHIBITION**: Under no circumstances should any additional features, functions, or code be autonomously implemented. All development must be explicitly authorized and directed by me.

**LEAN DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES**:
   - **Be Lean**: Eliminate all non-essential code and features
   - **Be Intentional**: Every line of code must serve a clear, defined purpose
   - Favor simplicity and readability over clever solutions
   - Remove unused or redundant code immediately
   - Optimize only when performance metrics indicate a need

   
7. **DEBUGGING AND TRACEBACK**:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
