Guide for Humans
================

Start Order (solo):
1. G0-T1 Parity Suite Expansion
2. G0-T2 UI Snapshot Baselines
3. G0-T3 Live Token Smoke Spec

Parallel Play After Gate 0:
- Lane A (Data & Content): G1A-T1 first, then G1A-T2 + G1A-T3 together once G1A-T1 is done.
- Lane B (Sending): G1B-T1 first, then G1B-T2 + G1B-T3 together once G1B-T1 is done.
- Lane C (Manual): G1C-T1 first, then G1C-T2 (needs G1C-T1 and Gate0 snapshots).

Agent Suggestions:
- 1 agent for Gate 0 (sequential).
- Up to 3 agents in Gate 1 (one per lane) after prerequisites.

Later Gates:
- Gate 2 tasks become available only when their listed adapters are complete; follow dependencies in order and keep one agent per Sequenced Only task.
- Gates 3–6 remain sequential unless their cards say Parallel OK; respect those notes when assigning agents.
